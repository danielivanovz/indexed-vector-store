I've wrote about it at my [blog/indexed-vector-store](https://danielivanov.me/blog/indexed-vector-store).

Used with [use-vector-store](https://github.com/danielivanovz/use-vector-store) to build a [demo](https://github.com/danielivanovz/indexed-vector-store-demo) and deployed at my [website](https://app.danielivanov.me/vector-database/).
